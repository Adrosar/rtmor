**RtMoR** is alternative to **Requestly**

## Why do I need RtMoR?

If you are working on an application in **React**, **Angular**, **VueJS**, you will definitely appreciate **RtMoR**. See the problem below that **RtMoR** is solving.

### Issue (story):

You need to debug your JavaScript application in production. Unfortunately, you cannot make a copy of such an environment and nor can you access JS scripts on the server.

Thanks to **RtMoR**, you can redirect the selected resource request to the local server.

So you can **safely work** in the **production** environment.



## Examples (Linux, bash)

Remember to build a project!
```bash
./scripts/dist.sh
```

Show help:
```bash
./build/linux-amd64/rtmor -help
```

Run proxy server that is listening on all network interfaces:
```bash
./build/linux-amd64/rtmor -start -listen 0.0.0.0:8888 -log BMW
```

Run with a configuration containing sample rules:
```bash
./build/linux-amd64/rtmor -start -listen 0.0.0.0:8888 -cfg ./configs/sample.yaml -log BMW
```

### Configuration file

The configuration file contains examples of using **RtMoR** â†’ `./configs/sample.yaml`



## Examples (Windows, cmd)

Run with a configuration containing sample rules:
```cmd
build\windows-amd64\rtmor.exe -start -listen 0.0.0.0:8888 -cfg configs\sample.yaml -log BMW
```



## HTTPS and Certificate

For HTTPS redirection to work, install the certificate on the device.

## Early stage

The software was created for personal use and is in the **early stages** of development, so **CLI** is subject to change.
